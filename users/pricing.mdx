Viewpoint offers a single subscription with two tiers, designed to give you access to multiple independent analysts in one place.

There are no upsells, no hidden fees, and no per-analyst payments. You choose the level of access that fits how you prefer to consume information.

## Membership tiers

**Read-only access, \$59,- per month**

This tier is for members who want **clear market insight without noise**.

You get:

- full access to all analyst briefings
- full access to research, charts, and updates
- multiple independent perspectives on the same market
- a structured environment focused on understanding, not hype

This tier is ideal if you:

- prefer to read and observe
- want context and reasoning
- make your own decisions without discussion

---

**Read + full chat accesses \$79,- per month**

This tier includes everything in the read-only plan, plus access to analyst discussion channels.

You get:

- all analyst content
- access to analyst desk chats
- Livestreams and podcasts
- the ability to ask questions and clarify views
- participation in structured, moderated discussions

This tier is ideal if you:

- want to understand how analysts think in real time
- like asking follow-up questions
- value dialogue over one-way content
- Engage with community of the specific analyst

All discussion happens in public, moderated channels.

### Payment currency and network

All subscribtions are made in:

- **USDC**
- **BEP-20 network**

Crypto payments are currently the only supported method. This provides fast settlement, global accessibility, and independence from traditional banking infrastructure.

Failure to use the correct network and stablecoin may result in losses and is the sole responsibility of the user doing the payment.

_Fiat payout options are planned for the future and are on the roadmap._

## What your subscription includes

With either tier, you get access to:

- multiple analysts instead of a single voice
- different frameworks and perspectives
- clear explanations of bias, scenarios, and invalidations
- updates when views change, not constant noise

---

## How this is different from private groups

Most private groups focus on:

- one analyst
- one framework
- one narrative

Viewpoint is designed for users who want:

- broader context
- comparison of views
- less dependence on a single opinion

You do not have to agree with every analyst. The value comes from seeing how perspectives differ.

---

## Voting and analyst ranking

As a member, you are asked to rank the analysts you find most valuable when you join or renew your subscription.

This ranking:

- directly influences how analysts are rewarded
- ensures the platform reflects what members value
- keeps incentives aligned with quality and relevance

You must rank at least 3 analysts up on renewal. You are encouraged to rank up to 5. Optionally, you have the option to select "chose previous month rankings"

If you do not update your ranking at renewal, your previous selection remains active.

---

## Billing and renewals

- Subscriptions are billed monthly
- You can cancel at any time
- Access continues until the end of your billing period
- There are no long-term commitments

---

## Who Viewpoint is for

Viewpoint is for you if you:

- want to understand markets, not chase calls
- value clear thinking over hype
- prefer structure over chaos
- want access to multiple analysts in one place
