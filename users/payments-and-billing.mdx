### Billing cycle

Viewpoint memberships are managed through Discord and have to be renewed every 30 days. Access to paid areas is tied directly to an active membership role within the server.

At the start of each 30-day cycle, members renew their membership and select their top 5 analysts which they found most usefull. This structure gives members flexibility while ensuring analyst channels remain clear and intentional.

If a membership is not renewed at the end of a billing cycle, paid access is automatically removed until renewal is completed. This keeps access aligned with active memberships at all times.

### Cancellations

Memberships automatically cancel at the end of each 30 day cycle. If not renewed, access to paid areas remains inactive.

### Refund policy

Viewpoint operates a strict no-refund policy.

Once a billing period has started, payments are non-refundable. This applies to all memberships, including cases of non-use or missed time.

This policy exists to ensure fairness, clarity, and consistency for all members.
