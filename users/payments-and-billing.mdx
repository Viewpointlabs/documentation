## Paying with crypto

Viewpoint supports **crypto payments** through its official Discord payment partner, **Subscord**.

This allows members to subscribe directly inside Discord using cryptocurrency, without needing to leave the platform or create additional accounts.

### How crypto payments work

When you choose to subscribe:

- payment is processed through Subscord
- access is granted automatically inside Discord
- your subscription is linked to your Discord account

Once payment is confirmed, your access unlocks instantly according to your chosen tier.

### Supported payment methods

Through Subscord, members can pay using:

- USDC on the BEP20 or ERC20 network
- commonly used crypto wallets
- standard on-chain transactions

Exact supported assets and networks are shown at checkout and may expand over time.

### Security and reliability

Payments are handled by Subscord, a dedicated Discord monetization provider used by thousands of servers.

Viewpoint does not custody funds or store payment details. Access control is automated based on confirmed payments.

## Billing cycle

Viewpoint memberships are managed through Discord and have to be renewed every 30 days. Access to paid areas is tied directly to an active membership role within the server.

At the start of each 30-day cycle, members renew their membership and select their top 5 analysts which they found most usefull. This structure gives members flexibility while ensuring analyst channels remain clear and intentional.

If a membership is not renewed at the end of a billing cycle, paid access is automatically removed until renewal is completed. This keeps access aligned with active memberships at all times.

## Cancellations

Memberships automatically cancel at the end of each 30 day cycle. If not renewed, access to paid areas remains inactive.

## Refund policy

Viewpoint operates a strict no-refund policy.

Once a billing period has started, payments are non-refundable. This applies to all memberships, including cases of non-use or missed time.

This policy exists to ensure fairness, clarity, and consistency for all members.
