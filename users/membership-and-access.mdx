Viewpoint is intentionally structured to keep information clear, discoverable, and easy to follow. Instead of a single noisy feed, content is organized into dedicated areas with a clear purpose. This allows members to focus on analysis, context, and discussion without being overwhelmed by constant chatter.

The platform is built around separation of analyses and conversation, so valuable insights remain visible and useful over time rather than being lost in fast-moving chats.

### Public vs paid areas

Viewpoint consists of both public and paid areas.

Public areas offer a first look into the platform and the community. They are designed to showcase the tone, structure, and quality of discussion, without exposing full analysis or premium content.

Paid areas unlock full access to analyst channels, deeper market context, and ongoing discussions. This separation keeps the core experience focused and ensures that analysts and members engage in a committed, high-quality environment.

### Analyst channels

Each analyst on viewpoint operates within their own structured channels. This makes it easy to follow specific perspectives without interference or noise from unrelated content.

Analyst channels typically include:

- market analysis, data and macro outlooks
- charts and updates as conditions evolve
- discussion areas for questions and clarification

This structure allows members to track how an analyst’s view develops over time, rather than consuming isolated opinions.

### Reading vs participating

Viewpoint is designed to work for both passive and active members.

Some members prefer to read analysis, follow market context, and absorb different viewpoints at their own pace. Others actively ask questions, challenge assumptions, and participate in discussions with analysts and peers.

Both approaches are valid. Participation is encouraged, but never required. The platform is structured so that reading alone already delivers value, while thoughtful participation deepens understanding and perspective.
