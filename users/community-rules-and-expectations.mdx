### Behaviour standards

Viewpoint is designed to be a calm, focused environment where meaningful market discussion can take place. Members are expected to communicate thoughtfully, stay relevant to the topic being discussed, and contribute in a way that improves collective understanding.

Healthy disagreement is welcome. Dismissing others, provoking conflict, or repeatedly posting low-effort or off-topic messages is not. The quality of the platform depends on members respecting the time, attention, and experience of others. Behaviour that consistently disrupts discussion or degrades the environment may lead to moderation action.

### No financial advice disclaimer

All content on viewpoint is shared for informational and educational purposes only. Analysts explain how they interpret market conditions, structure risk, and think through scenarios based on their own experience.

Nothing on the platform should be interpreted as financial advice, investment recommendations, or instructions to buy or sell any asset. Markets involve risk, and each member is fully responsible for their own decisions, position sizing, and outcomes. Viewpoint exists to support better thinking, not to replace personal judgment.

### Respect analysts and members

Viewpoint brings together people with different strategies, time horizons, and risk tolerances. Analysts are not expected to be right all the time, and members are not expected to agree with every view.

Respect means engaging with ideas rather than attacking individuals. Constructive questions, alternative viewpoints, and critical discussion are encouraged when they are expressed professionally. Harassment, personal insults, or pressure directed at analysts or members is not acceptable and undermines the purpose of the platform.

### Moderation approach

Viewpoint is actively moderated to protect discussion quality and maintain a professional atmosphere. Moderation is not about enforcing opinions or restricting debate, but about keeping conversations productive and aligned with the platform’s standards.

Moderators may intervene by redirecting discussions, issuing warnings, limiting participation, or removing content when necessary. Repeated or serious violations may result in temporary or permanent loss of access. All moderation actions are taken with the goal of preserving a fair, respectful, and high-value environment for everyone involved.
