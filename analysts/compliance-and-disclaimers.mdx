### No financial advice

All analyst content on viewpoint is strictly informational and educational. Analysts explain how they interpret markets and manage their own perspectives, not what others should do.

At no point should analysts frame content as instructions, recommendations, or advice tailored to individual members. Members remain fully responsible for their own decisions and outcomes.

---

### No performance promises

Analysts must not make promises or claims regarding performance, profitability, or future returns.

Markets are uncertain by nature, and analysis reflects probabilities and scenarios, not guarantees. Any language suggesting certainty, assured outcomes, or consistent profitability is not allowed.

---

### Responsibility separation

Analysts are responsible for the analysis they share and the clarity with which they present it. Members are responsible for how they act on information.

Viewpoint acts as a platform that facilitates discussion and access to perspectives but does not endorse, verify, or validate individual trading decisions or results. This separation is fundamental to maintaining transparency, accountability, and trust on the platform.
