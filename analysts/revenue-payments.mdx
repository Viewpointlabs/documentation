## Revenue share explained

Revenue on Viewpoint is shared between the platform and its analysts through a transparent, rule-based model. A fixed percentage of total subscription revenue is allocated to analysts each month. The remaining portion covers platform operations, marketing initiatives (exposure, spaces, pod casts, videos) infrastructure, and ongoing development.Analyst earnings are determined by:

- active paid members
- member voting at renewal and ranking
- predefined weighting and caps

<Info>
  _There is no discretionary adjustment. The formula is fixed, known in advance, and applied equally to all analysts.Each month, analysts receive:_
</Info>

Each month, analysts receive:

- a full ranked overview
- their percentage share
- their final payout
- the underlying totals used in the calculation

This structure ensures that earnings scale with:

- audience growth
- continued relevance
- sustained contribution

Rather than one-time promotions.

## [**​**](http://localhost:3002/analysts/monetization#analyst-revenue-example)**Analyst revenue example**

**Assumptions:**

- 1,000 active paying users
- 6 analysts
- Each user submits a ranking
- Total points distributed = 1,000 users × 15 points = **15,000 points**

## 

### Points distribution example

Total points issued (example): **15,000**

| Analyst   | Points     | % of points |
| :-------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| Analyst A | 4,500      | 30%         |
| Analyst B | 3,600      | 24%         |
| Analyst C | 2,700      | 18%         |
| Analyst D | 1,950      | 13%         |
| Analyst E | 1,350      | 9%          |
| Analyst F | 900        | 6%          |
| **Total** | **15,000** | **100%**    |

## Performance example based on \$59 / \$79 pricing

### Assumptions

- Total users: **1,000**
- Analysts: **6**
- Pricing mix:
  - **\$59** (read-only) → **60%** → 600 users
  - **\$79** (read + chat) → **40%** → 400 users
- Platform fee: **10%**
- Analyst pool: **90%**
- Analyst pool split:
  - **20% baseline**
  - **80% performance**
- No soft cap applied

## [**​**](http://localhost:3002/analysts/monetization#revenue-pool-structure)**Revenue pool structure**

From total subscription revenue:

- **10%** is allocated to the platform
- **90%** is allocated to the analyst pool

The analyst pool is then split into:

- **20% baseline pool**
- **80% performance pool**

Baseline pool = **\$12,060**\
Split equally across 6 analysts:

- **\$2,010 per analyst**

### Performance payout allocation

| Analyst   | % of points | Performance payout |
| :-------- | :---------- | :----------------- |
| Analyst A | 30%         | \$14,472           |
| Analyst B | 24%         | \$11,578           |
| Analyst C | 18%         | \$8,683            |

### [**​**](http://localhost:3002/analysts/monetization#earnings-comparison-table)**Earnings comparison table**

To make earnings easier to interpret, the table below translates each analyst’s **point share** into an **approximate number of users represented**, and compares Viewpoint earnings with what the same number of analysts would generate in **a private group about \$30/month subscription.**

| Analyst   | Point share | Approx. users represented | Viewpoint payout | Private earnings (\$30) | Difference     |
| :-------- | :---------- | :------------------------ | :--------------- | :---------------------- | :------------- |
| Analyst A | 30%         | ~300                      | \$16,482         | \$9,000                 | **\+ \$7,482** |
| Analyst B | 24%         | ~240                      | \$13,588         | \$7,200                 | **\+ \$6,388** |
| Analyst C | 18%         | ~180                      | \$10,693         | \$5,400                 | **\+ \$5,293** |
| Analyst D | 13%         | ~130                      | \$8,281          | \$3,900                 | **\+ \$4,381** |
| Analyst E | 9%          | ~90                       | \$6,352          | \$2,700                 | **\+ \$3,652** |
| Analyst F | 6%          | ~60                       | \$4,904          | \$1,800                 | **\+ \$3,104** |

### [**​**](http://localhost:3002/analysts/monetization#soft-cap-on-dominance)**Soft cap on dominance**

To prevent one analyst from capturing a disproportionate share of revenue and be the face of the platform solely, a soft cap applies.The rules are:

- The first **35%** of an analyst’s point share is paid at full weight
- Any share **above 35%** is paid at **50% weight**

This means:

- being the top analyst is still highly rewarded and better than private groups
- but the marginal benefit of extreme monopoly dominance is reduced
- the system creates a situation that it remains attractive for multiple high-quality analysts

## Why Viewpoint earnings scale better

This comparison highlights three structural advantages:

1. **Shared demand**\
   Analysts benefit not only from their own audience, but from platform-wide demand.
2. **Higher ARPU**\
   Users pay slightly more overall than a single private group, but receive more value, allowing analysts to earn more per unit of attention.
3. **Lower operational burden**\
   No individual subscription management, payment handling, or server maintenance.

## Payments and payout process

Analyst payouts on Viewpoint are handled on a **fixed monthly schedule** using cryptocurrency. This process is designed to be transparent, predictable, and easy to verify.

### Payout timing

- Earnings are calculated on a **monthly basis every 30th of the month**
- Voting and rankings are consolidated at the **end of each calendar month**
- Final calculations are completed once all data is reconciled
- **Payments are executed before, but no later than the 5th of the following month**

This timing allows:

- all renewals to be accounted for
- voting data to settle
- final rankings and shares to be confirmed

### Payout currency and network

All analyst payouts are made in:

- **USDC**
- **ERC-20 network**

Currently, crypto payouts are the only supported method.

This ensures:

- fast settlement
- global accessibility
- no dependency on banking infrastructure

<Note>
  Fiat payout options are planned for the future and are on the roadmap, but are **not available currently.**
</Note>

---

### Receiving wallet

Each analyst must provide:

- a valid **ERC-20 wallet address**
- capable of receiving USDC

This wallet will be used for all payouts unless updated in advance.

The **platform payout wallet** used to distribute funds is disclosed internally to analysts for transparency.

---

### Transparency and verification

Each monthly payout includes:

- a published ranking and earnings summary
- individual payout amounts per analyst
- on-chain transaction references

This allows analysts to:

- independently verify payments
- confirm totals
- reconcile earnings against published results

There are no hidden deductions or manual adjustments.

### Important notes

- Gas fees are paid from the payout transaction amount
- Analysts are responsible for any local tax or reporting obligations
- Incorrect or outdated wallet addresses are the responsibility of the analyst
