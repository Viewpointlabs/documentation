## Revenue share explained

Revenue on Viewpoint is shared between the platform and its analysts through a **transparent, rule-based model**.

A fixed percentage of total subscription revenue is allocated to analysts each month. The remaining portion covers platform operations, marketing initiatives (such as exposure, spaces, podcasts, videos), infrastructure, and ongoing development.

Analyst earnings are determined by:

- active paid members
- member voting at subscription renewal and ranking
- predefined weighting and caps

<Info>
  There is **no discretionary adjustment**. The formula is fixed, known in advance, and applied equally to all analysts.
</Info>

Each month, analysts receive:

- a full ranked overview
- their percentage share
- their final payout
- the underlying totals used in the calculation

This structure ensures that earnings scale with audience growth, continued relevance, and sustained contribution, rather than one-time promotions.

## Analyst revenue example

Assumptions

This example uses the following base assumptions:

- 1,000 active paying users
- 6 analysts
- Each user submits a ranking
- Total points distributed = 1,000 users × 15 points = **15,000 points**

Pricing mix:

- **\$59** (read-only access) → 60% → 600 users
- **\$79** (read + chat access) → 40% → 400 users

Platform fee: **10%**\
Analyst pool: **90%**

Analyst pool split:

- **20% baseline pool**
- **80% performance pool**

No soft cap is applied in this primary example.

---

### Revenue pool structure

The monthly subscription revenue is divided as follows:

- **10%** is allocated to the platform
- **90%** is allocated to the **analyst pool**

The analyst pool is then further split into:

- **20% baseline pool**
- **80% performance pool**

Baseline rewards participation and steady relevance, while performance rewards member preference.

---

### Performance payout allocation

Once total points are aggregated, the performance pool is allocated proportionally based on each analyst’s share of points.

| Analyst   | % of points | Performance payout |
| :-------- | :---------- | :----------------- |
| Analyst A | 30%         | \$14,472           |
| Analyst B | 24%         | \$11,578           |
| Analyst C | 18%         | \$8,683            |
| Analyst D | 13%         | \$6,271            |
| Analyst E | 9%          | \$4,342            |
| Analyst F | 6%          | \$2,894            |
| **Total** | **100%**    | **\$48,240**       |

---

### Final monthly earnings per analyst

Each analyst receives their baseline share plus their performance share:

| Analyst        | Baseline | Performance | **Total payout** |
| :------------- | :------- | :---------- | :--------------- |
| Analyst A      | \$2,010  | \$14,472    | **\$16,482**     |
| Analyst B      | \$2,010  | \$11,578    | **\$13,588**     |
| Analyst C      | \$2,010  | \$8,683     | **\$10,693**     |
| Analyst D      | \$2,010  | \$6,271     | **\$8,281**      |
| Analyst E      | \$2,010  | \$4,342     | **\$6,352**      |
| Analyst F      | \$2,010  | \$2,894     | **\$4,904**      |
| **Total paid** |          |             | **\$60,300**     |

This shows how the available analyst pool (\$60,300) is split according to contribution.

### Earnings comparison table

To make analyst earnings easier to interpret, the table below translates each analyst’s point share into an approximate number of users represented. It then compares Viewpoint earnings with what the same number of users would generate if they were in a **private \$30/month subscription**.

| Analyst   | Point share | Approx. users represented | Viewpoint payout | Private earnings (\$30) | Difference     |
| :-------- | :---------- | :------------------------ | :--------------- | :---------------------- | :------------- |
| Analyst A | 30%         | ~300                      | \$16,482         | \$9,000                 | **\+ \$7,482** |
| Analyst B | 24%         | ~240                      | \$13,588         | \$7,200                 | **\+ \$6,388** |
| Analyst C | 18%         | ~180                      | \$10,693         | \$5,400                 | **\+ \$5,293** |
| Analyst D | 13%         | ~130                      | \$8,281          | \$3,900                 | **\+ \$4,381** |
| Analyst E | 9%          | ~90                       | \$6,352          | \$2,700                 | **\+ \$3,652** |
| Analyst F | 6%          | ~60                       | \$4,904          | \$1,800                 | **\+ \$3,104** |

<Check>
  This highlights how analysts can often **earn more on Viewpoint than from equivalent private subscriptions**, due to shared demand and higher ARPU on the platform.

## Soft cap on dominance

To prevent one analyst from capturing a disproportionate share of revenue, a **soft cap** applies:

- the first **35%** of an analyst’s point share is paid at full weight
- any share **above 35%** is paid at **50% weight**

This ensures:

- top analysts still earn significantly
- extreme dominance does not crowd out others
- the system remains attractive for multiple high-quality contributors

## Why Viewpoint earnings scale better

Viewpoint’s structure creates several structural advantages:

### Shared demand

Analysts benefit not only from their own audience, but from platform-wide demand, increasing total potential earnings.

### Higher ARPU

Users pay slightly more than typical private groups but receive access to **multiple analysts and structured insight**, allowing analysts to earn more per unit of attention.

### Lower operational burden

Analysts are freed from subscription management, payment handling, and server maintenance, all of which are handled by the platform.

This allows them to focus on analysis and engagement.

---

## Payments and payout process

Analyst payouts on Viewpoint are handled on a **fixed monthly schedule** using cryptocurrency. The process is designed to be **transparent, predictable, and easy to verify**.

---

### Payout timing

- earnings are calculated on a **monthly basis**
- voting and rankings are consolidated at the **end of the calendar month**
- final calculations are completed once all data is reconciled
- payouts are executed before, but up to**the 5th of the following month**

This ensures all subscriptions and renewals are accounted for before payouts.

---

### Payout currency and network

All analyst payouts are made in:

- **USDC**
- **BEP-20 or ERC-20 network**

Crypto payouts are currently the only supported method. This provides fast settlement, global accessibility, and independence from traditional banking infrastructure.

_Fiat payout options are planned for the future and are on the roadmap._

---

### Receiving wallet

Each analyst must provide a valid **BEP-20 or ERC-20 wallet address** capable of receiving USDC. This wallet will be used for all payouts unless updated in advance.

The platform payout wallet is disclosed internally to analysts for transparency.

---

### Transparency and verification

Each monthly payout includes:

- a published ranking and earnings summary
- individual payout amounts per analyst
- on-chain transaction references

This allows analysts to independently verify payments, confirm totals, and reconcile earnings against published results. There are **no hidden deductions or manual adjustments**.

---

### Important notes

- gas fees are paid from the payout transaction amount
- analysts are responsible for any local tax or reporting obligations
- incorrect or outdated wallet addresses are the responsibility of the analyst
