description: "What it means to be part of the Viewpoint analyst group"
---

Viewpoint is a shared analyst desk, not a signal group and not an influencer feed. As an analyst, you contribute your independent market perspective to a collective environment where users gain value from multiple viewpoints, not a single narrative.

You retain:

- your identity
- your style
- your intellectual ownership

You participate in:

- a transparent, performance-based revenue model
- a shared standard of quality and professionalism

## Long-term alignment

Viewpoint is designed to reduce the operational burden analysts face elsewhere.

There are:

- no individual subscription management tasks
- no payment handling
- no personal support obligations
- no need to run or moderate a separate server

Analysts focus on what they do best:

- market analysis
- clear communication
- thoughtful perspective

The platform handles the rest.

## Professional positioning

Viewpoint is structured as an analyst desk, not a signal group.

Being part of the platform:

- elevates how your work is perceived
- places you alongside other serious analysts
- reinforces credibility through structure and transparency

This positioning attracts a different type of user:

- less impulsive
- more engaged
- more interested in understanding markets

## Why joining Viewpoint adds value

Joining Viewpoint is not about replacing what you already do. It is about **amplifying** it. Viewpoint should be an upgrade to your own groups (if any) not a replacement by default.

Viewpoint is designed to increase an analyst’s reach, relevance, and earning potential by placing them inside a **shared ecosystem**, rather than a standalone channel.

---

### Expanded visibility and marketing exposure

On Viewpoint, your analysis is not only seen by your own audience.

You are exposed to:

- users who joined for other analysts
- members who would not have discovered you otherwise
- a broader audience already willing to pay for insight

This creates continuous discovery without additional marketing effort.

Over time, this compounds:

- followers
- recognition
- trust

Especially for analysts whose work resonates but whose distribution is limited.

---

### Stronger X reach through shared audiences

Viewpoint naturally increases reach on X.

As analysts post and engage:

- users follow multiple analysts across the desk
- your content is shared by members who discovered you via others
- cross-pollination occurs between analyst audiences

Instead of competing for attention, analysts benefit from **shared distribution**.

This leads to:

- organic follower growth
- higher engagement quality
- visibility beyond your existing circle

---

### Larger and more scalable revenue stream

Viewpoint pools demand.

Rather than relying only on your own subscriber base, your earnings are driven by:

- total platform users
- member preference and engagement
- shared willingness to pay for quality analysis

This allows analysts to:

- earn more with fewer direct subscribers
- benefit from platform growth
- reduce dependency on constant self-promotion

Revenue scales with relevance, not with manual marketing effort.

---

## Existing private communities

Analysts are **not required** to shut down or immediately migrate their existing private communities to Viewpoint. Viewpoint is designed to **coexist** with private groups, not to force a binary choice.

Analysts may continue to operate:

- private Discords
- Patreons
- Whop groups
- or other subscription-based communities

This flexibility is intentional and respects the work analysts have already put into building their audience.

---

### How private groups and Viewpoint coexist

Viewpoint serves a different purpose than most private groups.

Private communities typically attract users who:

- want a single analyst only
- prefer a smaller, more focused environment
- are already deeply aligned with that analyst’s style

Viewpoint is designed for users who:

- want exposure to multiple perspectives
- value context over isolated views
- prefer one subscription instead of several

Both models can exist in parallel without conflict.

---

### Free entry access for private communities

To support onboarding and reduce friction, Viewpoint allows analysts to offer their existing members **one month of free access**.

This is done via:

- a dedicated entry code
- limited in duration and usage (typically 30 days)
- tied specifically to that analyst’s onboarding

This allows analysts to:

- introduce Viewpoint to their community
- let members experience the platform without commitment
- demonstrate the added value of multiple analyst perspectives

---

### How free entry works

Members who join via an entry code:

- receive access for a fixed trial period, typically one month
- do not count toward analyst earnings
- do not participate in voting during the trial unless user renews and subscribes
- are clearly marked as trial users internally

This ensures that:

- promotional access does not distort payouts
- existing analysts are treated fairly
- trials are used for discovery, not monetisation shortcuts

---

### Gradual migration, not forced movement

Analysts are not expected to duplicate everything they post in their private groups. Although it is up to their own decision whether they do this or not.

However, many analysts naturally find that:

- posting core views on Viewpoint reaches a broader audience
- Viewpoint reduces administrative overhead
- earnings scale more efficiently over time

As a result, migration tends to happen **organically**, not by mandate.

Some analysts may:

- keep their private group as a premium or niche offering
- slowly reduce activity there
- or eventually consolidate fully into Viewpoint

All approaches are acceptable.

---

### No exclusivity requirement

Viewpoint does not require:

- exclusivity
- minimum posting quotas tied to private groups
- content parity guarantees

Analysts retain full control over:

- where they publish
- how they engage their audience
- how they position Viewpoint alongside their existing products

## Role & responsibilities

As an analyst, you are expected to:

- Publish regular market commentary in your designated channels
- Clearly communicate your current bias, key scenarios, and invalidations
- Participate constructively in discussion where appropriate
- Respect platform rules, boundaries, and disclosure requirements

You are not expected to:

- provide 1-to-1 guidance
- answer every message
- predict outcomes
- manage or moderate the entire server

---

## Free promo access rules

To support onboarding and growth, Viewpoint allows **controlled promotional access** for analysts.

This is typically used when:

- a new analyst joins the platform
- an analyst introduces their existing audience to Viewpoint
- a partnership announcement is made

Promo access is granted through time-limited codes that allow users to join for a defined period, usually one month.

Important rules apply:

- promo users do not count toward analyst payouts
- promo users do not participate in renewal voting
- promo access is always disclosed internally to all analysts

This ensures that promotional activity:

- helps discovery
- does not distort earnings
- remains fair to existing analysts

Promo access is a growth tool, not a revenue shortcut.

---

## Trial periods for new analysts

New analysts may be offered an initial trial period when joining Viewpoint.

The purpose of this period is to:

- allow analysts to become familiar with the platform
- understand how members engage
- establish posting rhythm and communication style

During this period:

- expectations are communicated clearly
- performance metrics are observed
- feedback may be shared if needed

Trial periods are not punitive.\
They exist to ensure long-term alignment between analysts, members, and the platform.

Once the trial period ends, analysts participate fully in the standard revenue-sharing model under the same rules as everyone else.
