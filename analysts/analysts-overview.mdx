description: "What it means to be a Viewpoint analyst"
---

Viewpoint is a shared analyst desk, not a signal group and not an influencer feed.

As an analyst on our platform, you contribute your independent market perspective to a collective environment where users gain value from multiple viewpoints, not a single narrative.

You retain:

- your identity
- your style
- your intellectual ownership

You participate in:

- a transparent, performance-based revenue model
- a shared standard of quality and professionalism

## Role & responsibilities

As an analyst, you are expected to:

- Publish regular market commentary in your designated channels
- Clearly communicate your current bias, key scenarios, and invalidations
- Participate constructively in discussion where appropriate
- Respect platform rules, boundaries, and disclosure requirements

You are not expected to:

- provide 1-to-1 guidance
- answer every message
- predict outcomes
- manage or moderate the entire server

## How analysts add value

Analysts add value by:

- helping users understand _why_ markets move, not just _what_ moves
- presenting structured thinking instead of hype
- offering differentiated perspectives that challenge consensus

Consistency, clarity, and honesty matter more than frequency.
