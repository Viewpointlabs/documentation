## What to post

Analysts are encouraged to post:

- **Market bias**\
  Your current directional or structural view, including uncertainty where applicable.
- **Scenarios**\
  What could happen, under what conditions, and how you would reassess.
- **Context & reasoning**\
  Macro drivers, technical structure, on-chain context, sentiment, or flow, depending on your specialty.
- **Updates**\
  When your view changes, or when a key level / assumption is invalidated.

## What not to post

Analysts must **not** post:

- guarantees or promises of profit
- “sure thing” language
- calls without context
- exaggerated claims (“this will moon”, “easy money”)
- instructions framed as personal financial advice

Viewpoint is not a place for hype, urgency tactics, or performance marketing.

## Tone & clarity expectations

- Write clearly and directly
- Avoid excessive jargon where possible
- State assumptions explicitly
- Acknowledge uncertainty when it exists

It is acceptable, and encouraged, to say:

> “I don’t know yet”\
> “This scenario failed”\
> “I was wrong here”

Credibility is built through transparency, not certainty.
