## How analysts add value

Viewpoint is built around understanding, not prediction. Analysts add value by helping members make sense of markets in a way that goes beyond isolated calls or short-term noise.

The most valuable analysts on Viewpoint are not those who speak the loudest or post the most, but those who consistently provide **clarity, structure, and perspective**.

---

### Explaining the why behind market moves

Markets move for reasons, even when outcomes are uncertain.

Analysts add value by:

- explaining underlying drivers
- connecting price action to context
- highlighting what actually matters versus what is just noise

Rather than reacting to every candle or headline, analysts help users understand:

- why a move is happening
- what assumptions are changing
- what conditions could sustain or reverse it

This allows users to form their own conclusions instead of blindly following signals.

---

### Structuring uncertainty into scenarios

Markets are not binary. Analysts add value by framing uncertainty through **scenarios**, not predictions.

This includes:

- outlining multiple possible outcomes
- assigning conditions to each scenario
- clearly stating what would invalidate a view

By doing so, analysts help users:

- think probabilistically
- avoid emotional decision-making
- adapt as information changes

Being explicit about uncertainty is a strength, not a weakness.

---

### Presenting structured thinking instead of hype

Hype is easy. Structure is hard.

Viewpoint prioritises analysts who:

- organise their thoughts clearly
- separate opinion from fact
- explain reasoning step by step

Structured thinking allows users to:

- follow logic
- assess risk
- understand disagreements between analysts

This is especially valuable when different analysts reach different conclusions using different frameworks.

---

### Offering differentiated perspectives

Consensus is visible everywhere. Value comes from **independent thinking**.

Analysts add value by:

- challenging popular narratives
- presenting alternative interpretations
- highlighting overlooked risks or opportunities

Disagreement is not only allowed on Viewpoint, it is encouraged — as long as it is reasoned and respectful.

Users benefit most when they can see:

- why analysts disagree
- what assumptions differ
- how frameworks lead to different conclusions

---

### Maintaining consistency over time

Trust is built over time, not in isolated posts.

Consistency means:

- showing up with a coherent framework
- updating views when conditions change
- acknowledging when assumptions fail

Analysts add value by being intellectually consistent, not by being right every time.

This allows users to:

- understand an analyst’s process
- contextualise wins and losses
- follow evolution in thinking

---

### Communicating with clarity and honesty

Clarity reduces risk.

Analysts add value by:

- avoiding vague or ambiguous language
- stating confidence levels explicitly
- distinguishing facts from opinion

Honesty includes:

- admitting uncertainty
- acknowledging mistakes
- updating views when wrong

This builds credibility far more effectively than overconfidence.

---

### Supporting learning, not dependency

The goal is not to create followers who depend on calls.

Analysts add value by:

- helping users learn how to think
- encouraging independent assessment
- explaining frameworks rather than instructions

Over time, this creates a healthier, more engaged user base that:

- stays longer
- asks better questions
- values depth over immediacy

---

### Quality over frequency

Posting often is not the same as adding value.

On Viewpoint:

- quality matters more than volume
- clarity matters more than speed
- relevance matters more than constant activity

Some of the most valuable contributions are:

- timely reframing of a market narrative
- clear invalidation of a prior view
- calm context during volatile periods

## What to post

Analysts are encouraged to post:

- **Market bias**\
  Your current directional or structural view, including uncertainty where applicable.
- **Scenarios**\
  What could happen, under what conditions, and how you would reassess.
- **Context & reasoning**\
  Macro drivers, technical structure, on-chain context, sentiment, or flow, depending on your specialty.
- **Updates**\
  When your view changes, or when a key level / assumption is invalidated.

---

## What not to post

Analysts must **not** post:

- guarantees or promises of profit
- “sure thing” language
- calls without context
- exaggerated claims (“this will moon”, “easy money”)
- instructions framed as personal financial advice

Viewpoint is not a place for hype, urgency tactics, or performance marketing.

---

## Tone & clarity expectations

- Write clearly and directly
- Avoid excessive jargon where possible
- State assumptions explicitly
- Acknowledge uncertainty when it exists

It is acceptable, and encouraged, to say:

> “I don’t know yet”\
> “This scenario failed”\
> “I was wrong here”

Credibility is built through transparency, not certainty.
