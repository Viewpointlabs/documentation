Viewpoint is built as a long-term partnership between the platform and its analysts. The goal is simple: align incentives so that analysts who consistently add value are rewarded, without forcing them into marketing-heavy or maintenance-heavy setups.

This is not a fixed-fee arrangement, and it is not a typical affiliate model. Earnings are tied to **member decisions and relevance**, not hype or follower counts alone.

## How analyst earnings are calculated

Analyst earnings are calculated on a **monthly basis**, using member rankings collected at **subscription renewal**.

Each active paying member submits a ranked selection of analysts. These rankings are converted into points and aggregated across all active subscriptions at the end of the month.

Only **active, paid subscriptions** are included in the calculation.

---

## Voting and points system

When a member joins or renews their subscription, they are required to rank analysts.

Each ranking translates into points:

- Rank 1 → 5 points
- Rank 2 → 4 points
- Rank 3 → 3 points
- Rank 4 → 2 points
- Rank 5 → 1 point

<Note>
  Members must select **at least 3 analysts**, and are encouraged to select 5.
</Note>

If a member does not update their ranking at renewal, their **previous ranking carries forward**. Additionally, members have the option to select "select my previous submission".

At the end of the month, all points from all active members are summed.

If a user selects fewer than 5, the remaining points are simply **not created**.

### Points distribution example

Total points issued (example): **15,000**

| Analyst   | Points     | % of points |
| :-------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| Analyst A | 4,500      | 30%         |
| Analyst B | 3,600      | 24%         |
| Analyst C | 2,700      | 18%         |
| Analyst D | 1,950      | 13%         |
| Analyst E | 1,350      | 9%          |
| Analyst F | 900        | 6%          |
| **Total** | **15,000** | **100%**    |

## Revenue pool structure

From total subscription revenue:

- **10%** is allocated to the platform
- **90%** is allocated to the analyst pool

The analyst pool is then split into:

- **20% baseline pool**
- **80% performance pool**

---

## Why a baseline exists

The baseline exists to:

- reward consistent participation
- reduce short-term volatility
- prevent earnings from swinging purely due to noise or timing

The baseline ensures that analysts who remain relevant but are not top-ranked every month still earn a fair share.

The performance pool ensures that analysts who are most preferred by members earn more.

### Baseline eligibility and anti-freeriding rule

The baseline pool exists to reduce volatility and reward consistent participation.\
However, it is **not unconditional**.

<Note>
  **To prevent freeloading, the baseline is only paid to analysts who meet a minimum level of member relevance.**
</Note>

---

### How the baseline threshold works

Each month, the platform calculates:

1. **Total analyst revenue** for the month
2. **Average revenue per user**\
   (total analyst pool divided by active paying users)
3. **Baseline amount per analyst**\
   (baseline pool divided by number of analysts)

From this, a **minimum relevance threshold** is derived.

An analyst must receive enough votes to represent at least the **number of users equivalent to the baseline amount**, based on the average revenue per user.

### Why this rule exists

Without a threshold, an analyst could:

- remain inactive
- post rarely or not at all
- rely purely on others driving demand

The threshold ensures that:

- baseline rewards participation, not presence
- analysts remain accountable to members
- earnings reflect actual relevance

---

### Example (simplified)

Assume:

- 1,000 users
- Analyst pool generates an average of **\$56 per user**
- Baseline per analyst is **\$1,900**

To earn the baseline:

- an analyst must represent roughly\
  **\$1,900 ÷ \$56 ≈ 34 users**

If an analyst is not ranked often enough to reach this equivalent, the baseline is **not paid for that month**.

---

### What happens if the baseline threshold is not met

- The analyst does not receive the baseline portion for that month
- They still participate in the **performance pool**, based on points earned
- If the threshold is missed 2 months in a row, the platform holds the right to review participation and remove or replace the analyst.

This ensures fairness for:

- high-performing analysts
- consistently contributing analysts
- the platform as a whole

---

## What happens if users do not rank all 5 analysts

Users are required to rank **at least 3 analysts**, and are encouraged to rank up to 5. When a user ranks fewer than 5 analysts, **only the points corresponding to the ranks they selected are issued**.

There is **no automatic backfilling** of missing ranks.

---

## Why total points may be lower than the maximum

The theoretical maximum number of points assumes that **every user ranks all 5 analysts**.

In reality:

- some users will rank only 3 or 4
- new users may not yet be familiar with all analysts
- preferences naturally concentrate

As a result, the total points distributed in a month may be **lower than the maximum possible**.

This is expected and normal.

---

## Why this does not affect fairness

All calculations are based on **percentage share of total points actually issued**, not on an assumed maximum.

This means:

- analysts are compared only against points that exist
- missing points do not advantage or disadvantage anyone
- rankings remain proportional and fair

Example:

- If total points issued are 13,200 instead of 15,000
- Analyst shares are calculated from **13,200**, not from 15,000

The relative outcome remains the same.

---

## Incentive to rank more analysts

While users are only required to rank 3 analysts, ranking all 5 is encouraged because it:

- improves the accuracy of rankings
- better reflects user preferences
- strengthens the signal for analysts

To support this:

- users who rank all 5 may receive non-monetary incentives
- incomplete rankings are still valid, but less expressive

## Performance alignment

Viewpoint is designed so that:

- analysts who resonate with members earn more
- analysts who stop contributing naturally earn less
- no single analyst can permanently dominate the pool

Member voting is tied to **active subscriptions**, ensuring that payouts reflect real engagement, not passive follows or legacy popularity.

This creates a system where:

- quality compounds over time
- analysts are rewarded for clarity and consistency
- short-term hype is less effective than sustained insight
