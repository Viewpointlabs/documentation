title: "Partnerships & Monetization "
---

Viewpoint is built as a long-term partnership between the platform and its analysts.\
The goal is simple: align incentives so that analysts who consistently add value are rewarded, without forcing them into marketing-heavy or maintenance-heavy setups.

This is not a fixed-fee arrangement, and it is not a typical affiliate model.\
Earnings are tied to **member decisions and relevance**, not hype or follower counts alone.

---

## Revenue share basics

Revenue on Viewpoint is shared between the platform and its analysts through a transparent, rule-based model.

A fixed percentage of total subscription revenue is allocated to analysts each month.\
The remaining portion covers platform operations, infrastructure, and ongoing development.

Analyst earnings are determined by:

- active paid members
- member voting at renewal and ranking
- predefined weighting and caps

There is no discretionary adjustment.\
The formula is fixed, known in advance, and applied equally to all analysts.

Each month, analysts receive:

- a full ranked overview
- their percentage share
- their final payout
- the underlying totals used in the calculation

This structure ensures that earnings scale with:

- audience growth
- continued relevance
- sustained contribution

Rather than one-time promotions.

---

## How analyst earnings are calculated

Analyst earnings are calculated on a **monthly basis**, using member rankings collected at **subscription renewal**.

Each active paying member submits a ranked selection of analysts. These rankings are converted into points and aggregated across all active subscriptions at the end of the month.

Only **active, paid subscriptions** are included in the calculation.

---

## Voting and points system

When a member joins or renews their subscription, they are required to rank analysts.

Each ranking translates into points:

- Rank 1 → 5 points
- Rank 2 → 4 points
- Rank 3 → 3 points
- Rank 4 → 2 points
- Rank 5 → 1 point

Members must select **at least 3 analysts**, and are encouraged to select 5.

If a member does not update their ranking at renewal, their **previous ranking carries forward**.

At the end of the month, all points from all active members are summed.

If a user selects fewer than 5, the remaining points are simply **not created**.

---

## Revenue pool structure

From total subscription revenue:

- **10%** is allocated to the platform
- **90%** is allocated to the analyst pool

The analyst pool is then split into:

- **20% baseline pool**
- **80% performance pool**

---

## Why a baseline exists

The baseline exists to:

- reward consistent participation
- reduce short-term volatility
- prevent earnings from swinging purely due to noise or timing

The baseline ensures that analysts who remain relevant but are not top-ranked every month still earn a fair share.

The performance pool ensures that analysts who are most preferred by members earn more.

## Revenue example

Assumptions:

- 1,000 active paying users
- 6 analysts
- Each user submits a ranking
- Total points distributed = 1,000 users × 15 points = **15,000 points**

### Points distribution (example)

| Analyst   | Points     | % of points |
| :-------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| Analyst A | 4,500      | 30.0%       |
| Analyst B | 3,600      | 24.0%       |
| Analyst C | 2,700      | 18.0%       |
| Analyst D | 1,950      | 13.0%       |
| Analyst E | 1,350      | 9.0%        |
| Analyst F | 900        | 6.0%        |
| **Total** | **15,000** | **100%**    |

### Example with factual numbers

### Assumptions

- Total users: **1,000**
- Analysts: **6**
- Pricing:
  - **\$69** (no chat) → **60%** of users = 600 users
  - **\$89** (with chat) → **40%** of users = 400 users
- Platform fee: **10%**
- Analyst pool: **90%**
- Analyst pool split:
  - **20% baseline**
  - **80% performance**
- No soft cap applied in this example

### Baseline payout

Baseline pool = **\$13,860**\
Split equally across 6 analysts:

- **\$2,310 per analyst**

### Performance payout

| Analyst   | % of points | Performance payout |
| :-------- | :---------- | :----------------- |
| Analyst A | 30%         | \$16,632           |
| Analyst B | 24%         | \$13,306           |
| Analyst C | 18%         | \$9,979            |
| Analyst D | 13%         | \$7,207            |
| Analyst E | 9%          | \$4,990            |
| Analyst F | 6%          | \$3,326            |
| **Total** |             | **\$55,440**       |

### Final monthly earnings per analyst

| Analyst        | Baseline | Performance | **Total payout** |
| :------------- | :------- | :---------- | :--------------- |
| Analyst A      | \$2,310  | \$16,632    | **\$18,942**     |
| Analyst B      | \$2,310  | \$13,306    | **\$15,616**     |
| Analyst C      | \$2,310  | \$9,979     | **\$12,289**     |
| Analyst D      | \$2,310  | \$7,207     | **\$9,517**      |
| Analyst E      | \$2,310  | \$4,990     | **\$7,300**      |
| Analyst F      | \$2,310  | \$3,326     | **\$5,636**      |
| **Total paid** |          |             | **\$69,300**     |

## What happens if users do not rank all 5 analysts

Users are required to rank **at least 3 analysts**, and are encouraged to rank up to 5.

When a user ranks fewer than 5 analysts, **only the points corresponding to the ranks they selected are issued**.

There is **no automatic backfilling** of missing ranks.

---

## Why total points may be lower than the maximum

The theoretical maximum number of points assumes that **every user ranks all 5 analysts**.

In reality:

- some users will rank only 3 or 4
- new users may not yet be familiar with all analysts
- preferences naturally concentrate

As a result, the total points distributed in a month may be **lower than the maximum possible**.

This is expected and normal.

---

## Why this does not affect fairness

All calculations are based on **percentage share of total points actually issued**, not on an assumed maximum.

This means:

- analysts are compared only against points that exist
- missing points do not advantage or disadvantage anyone
- rankings remain proportional and fair

Example:

- If total points issued are 13,200 instead of 15,000
- Analyst shares are calculated from **13,200**, not from 15,000

The relative outcome remains the same.

---

## Incentive to rank more analysts

While users are only required to rank 3 analysts, ranking all 5 is encouraged because it:

- improves the accuracy of rankings
- better reflects user preferences
- strengthens the signal for analysts

To support this:

- users who rank all 5 may receive non-monetary incentives
- incomplete rankings are still valid, but less expressive

## Performance alignment

Viewpoint is designed so that:

- analysts who resonate with members earn more
- analysts who stop contributing naturally earn less
- no single analyst can permanently dominate the pool

Member voting is tied to **active subscriptions**, ensuring that payouts reflect real engagement, not passive follows or legacy popularity.

This creates a system where:

- quality compounds over time
- analysts are rewarded for clarity and consistency
- short-term hype is less effective than sustained insight

---

## Free promo access rules

To support onboarding and growth, Viewpoint allows **controlled promotional access** for analysts.

This is typically used when:

- a new analyst joins the platform
- an analyst introduces their existing audience to Viewpoint
- a partnership announcement is made

Promo access is granted through time-limited codes that allow users to join for a defined period, usually one month.

Important rules apply:

- promo users do not count toward analyst payouts
- promo users do not participate in renewal voting
- promo access is always disclosed internally to all analysts

This ensures that promotional activity:

- helps discovery
- does not distort earnings
- remains fair to existing analysts

Promo access is a growth tool, not a revenue shortcut.

---

## Trial periods for new analysts

New analysts may be offered an initial trial period when joining Viewpoint.

The purpose of this period is to:

- allow analysts to become familiar with the platform
- understand how members engage
- establish posting rhythm and communication style

During this period:

- expectations are communicated clearly
- performance metrics are observed
- feedback may be shared if needed

Trial periods are not punitive.\
They exist to ensure long-term alignment between analysts, members, and the platform.

Once the trial period ends, analysts participate fully in the standard revenue-sharing model under the same rules as everyone else.
