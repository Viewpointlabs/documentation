## Revenue share explained

Revenue on Viewpoint is shared between the platform and its analysts through a transparent, rule-based model.A fixed percentage of total subscription revenue is allocated to analysts each month. The remaining portion covers platform operations, marketing initiatives (exposure, spaces, pod casts, videos) infrastructure, and ongoing development.Analyst earnings are determined by:

- active paid members
- member voting at renewal and ranking
- predefined weighting and caps

There is no discretionary adjustment. The formula is fixed, known in advance, and applied equally to all analysts.Each month, analysts receive:

- a full ranked overview
- their percentage share
- their final payout
- the underlying totals used in the calculation

This structure ensures that earnings scale with:

- audience growth
- continued relevance
- sustained contribution

Rather than one-time promotions.

## **Analyst revenue example**

**Assumptions:**

- 1,000 active paying users
- 6 analysts
- Each user submits a ranking
- Total points distributed = 1,000 users × 15 points = **15,000 points**

## [**​**](http://localhost:3002/analysts/monetization#revenue-pool-structure)

### **Revenue pool structure**

From total subscription revenue:

- **10%** is allocated to the platform
- **90%** is allocated to the analyst pool

The analyst pool is then split into:

- **20% baseline pool**
- **80% performance pool**

| **Analyst** | **Points** | **% of points** |

### [**​**](http://localhost:3002/analysts/monetization#soft-cap-on-dominance)

### **Soft cap on dominance**

To prevent one analyst from capturing a disproportionate share of revenue and be the face of the platform solely, a soft cap applies.The rules are:

- The first **35%** of an analyst’s point share is paid at full weight
- Any share **above 35%** is paid at **50% weight**

This means:

- being the top analyst is still highly rewarded and better than private groups
- but the marginal benefit of extreme monopoly dominance is reduced
- the system creates a situation that it remains attractive for multiple high-quality analysts

### **Earnings comparison table**

To make earnings easier to interpret, the table below translates each analyst’s **point share** into an **approximate number of users represented**, and compares Viewpoint earnings with what the same number of analysts would generate in **a private group about \$30/month subscription.**

| **Analyst** | **Point share** | **Approx. users represented** | **Viewpoint payout** | **Private earnings (\$30)** | **Difference** |

| Analyst B   | 24%             | ~240                          | \$13,588             | \$7,200                     | **\+ \$6,388** |
| Analyst C   | 18%             | ~180                          | \$10,693             | \$5,400                     | **\+ \$5,293** |
| Analyst D   | 13%             | ~130                          | \$8,281              | \$3,900                     | **\+ \$4,381** |
| Analyst E   | 9%              | ~90                           | \$6,352              | \$2,700                     | **\+ \$3,652** |

### **Why Viewpoint earnings scale better**

This comparison highlights 3 structural advantages:

1. **Shared demand**\
   Analysts benefit not only from their own audience, but from platform-wide demand.
2. **Higher ARPU**\
   Users pay more overall, but receive more value from multiple analysts. Joining Viewpoint means the relative price would reflect only 2 or 3 analysts seperately.
3. **Lower operational burden**\
   No individual subscription management, payment handling, or server maintenance.
