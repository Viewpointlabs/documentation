description: "How analyst channels are structured on Viewpoint"
---

Viewpoint is designed as a shared analyst desk, not a collection of isolated signal rooms. To ensure clarity, consistency, and a high standard of experience for members, each analyst operates within a standardized channel structure.

**This structure serves 3 purposes:**

- It makes analyst content easy to follow for users
- It sets clear expectations for how and where analysts communicate
- It prevents noise, overlap, and misalignment across the platform

Every analyst receives the same channel layout, regardless of style or specialty - optionally, as per request it is possible to adjust styling more specific to the speciality of the analyst.

## Analyst categories

Each analyst is assigned a dedicated category within the server. This category acts as the analyst’s “desk”, a defined space where their thinking, updates, and interaction live.

The category contains multiple channels, each with a clear intent.

This separation is deliberate:\
users should be able to distinguish between structured analysis, ongoing updates, and discussion, without confusion.

## `#briefing` — Market stance & outlook

The briefing channel is the analyst’s primary communication channel.

This is where analysts articulate:

- their current market bias
- key scenarios and assumptions
- what they are watching next
- what would change their view

**Think of this channel as:**

> “Where do you stand right now, and why?”

Posts here are typically:

- structured
- written with intent
- less frequent, but more considered

This channel is read-only for members, ensuring clarity and signal over noise.

---

## `#research` — Context, depth, and evidence

The research channel exists to support the briefing.

Here, analysts expand on:

- deeper reasoning
- charts with commentary
- macro or on-chain context
- thesis updates or extensions

**This channel answers:**

> “What supports this view?”

Content here can be:

- more exploratory
- more visual
- more frequent than briefings

Research does not need to be perfectly polished, clarity and honesty matter more than presentation.

---

## `#desk-chat` — Discussion & clarification

The desk chat is where **interaction happens**.

This channel is intended for:

- follow-up questions
- clarification of posted views
- constructive discussion around scenarios

It is **not**:

- a signal feed
- a call room
- a place for personal portfolio advice

Access to this channel is limited to members on the **chat-enabled tier**.

The goal is dialogue, not direction.

## Why this structure matters

This standardized structure:

- makes analyst output easier to consume
- sets expectations for users and analysts alike
- prevents the platform from becoming chaotic as it scales
- reinforces Viewpoint’s positioning as a professional analyst environment

Analysts are free to express themselves, but within a framework that protects quality and usability.

---

## Flexibility within structure

While the structure is semi-fixed, how you use it is not.

Analysts may:

- post more frequently or less frequently
- lean macro, technical, on-chain, or hybrid
- use text, charts, or mixed formats

What matters is not volume, but consistency and clarity.
