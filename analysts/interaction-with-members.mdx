### How often to engage

Analysts are expected to engage on a regular and consistent basis. This does not require constant activity, but it does require presence. Unless an analyst choses to have view-only content, the below is applicable.

Analysts should share updates when market conditions change, follow up on prior analysis, and be available to answer questions related to their posted content. Consistency and clarity are valued more than frequency. The goal is to provide reliable context over time, not real-time commentary on every price move.

### What questions to answer

Analysts are encouraged to answer questions that help members better understand market structure, assumptions, scenarios, and risk considerations behind their analysis.

Questions that seek clarification, challenge reasoning, or explore alternative outcomes are welcome. Analysts are not expected to answer repetitive, low-effort, or speculative questions, nor questions that push for exact entries, exits, or position sizing. An analyst may or may not answer questions at their own discretion.

### Boundaries

Analysts must maintain clear professional boundaries.

Direct messages with members regarding trades, positions, or personal portfolios should be avoided. Analysts should not provide one-on-one guidance, personalized advice, or private confirmations of market views.

All meaningful discussion should take place within public analyst channels so that context and learning are shared equally among members.
